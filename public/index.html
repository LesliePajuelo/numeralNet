            Welcome to Numeral Net, a side-project, taken on by two Hack Rector students
            during solo week, built using <a href="https://github.com/harthur/brain">BrainJS</a> a javascript neural network library.</p>
          <p>The goal of this project was to gain familiarity with and exposure to javascripts' take
          on neural networking.</p>
          <p>Technologies we used are Node for the heavy lifting. Express for our routing and server architecture. Plain old javascript and jQuery for everything else.</p>
          <p>We've created a trained neural network, to a 0.02 error rate. It takes what you draw on the canvas and it calculates a confidence rating that the drawn number matches a digit between 0-9. It does this after being trained on 60,000 handwritten digits from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST data set</a>.</p>

          <p>If you've drawn digits in the box and tested you can see that the accuracy is very
          dependent on how the digit is drawn. The discrepancy is that while our network is 
          well trained with an error rate of 0.02,that error rate is against data it has trained on.</p>

          <p>Below is a sampling of what the MNIST data looks like for each digit. As you can see
          there is large variations on what our neural network considers a specific digit.</p>
          <p>Some of these numbers, such as the last seven looks to the human eye a lot an awful lot
          like the 6th one for example</p>

          final training error of0.023 in 10,783 seconds " class="img-rounded">
          <p>Part of the inaccuracies stem from the differences between how a digit is drawn 
          compared to what our network is expecting. The other part is that the drawing area is 
          translated to an array which represents the data in a form similar but not precisely matching
          the MNIST data</p>
          <p>The last part of the explanation for the inaccuracies is that a good neural network
          needs to be tuned to the data it expects to recieve. This fine tuning has not been done
          on this network so the weights and balances for each digit can be improved</p>
